INTRODUCTION
The tipping behavior reflects customer satisfaction/dissatisfaction with their rides. Here we are trying to analyze the highest tips in New York City (NYC) pickup & drop off points, received by NYC yellow taxi drivers per ride.
The tip amount depends on several factors such as fare amount, trip distance, pickup and drop off locations, travel speeds etc., We have taken these factors including the other factors in the NYC Yellow taxi dataset and predicted the highest tip pick-up and drop-off points for every ride.
As per the data dictionaries provided by NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission for the yellow taxi, the tip amount data has been included only for the payment made by the CREDIT CARD. We do not have the data for tips paid by cash. Hence, we must aggregate the data accordingly with the sample data of 1,20,000 transactions.
There were many data errors and lot of feature extractions required to be performed on the dataset in order to achieve the goal.

OBJECTIVE:
Our Objective is to predict the highest tips based on the several factors on every ride that the NYC YELLOW TAXI Drivers would receive.

METHODOLGY:
As a part of data exploration, I tried to dig into the data to get some insights. Here are some of the interesting insights that I could gather, remaining is also plotted in the notebook.
